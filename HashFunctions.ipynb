A shift of one digit to the left means the digit represents 10 times more (ex: 2 and 20), two spaces to the left means multiplying by 100. Stated another way, the rightmost position of a base 10 integer represents the number of *ones* ($10^0$), the second from the right position represents the number of *tens* ($10^1$), the third from the right position represents the number of *hundreds* ($10^2$), and the $n^{th}$ position from the right represents the number of $10^ns$.

Base 2 is especially important for computers since data is usually represented by elements that can be in one of only two states.
