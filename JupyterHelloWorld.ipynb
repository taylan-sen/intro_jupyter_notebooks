The most common ***markup language*** you are probably familar with is ***hyper text markup language***, more commonly known as ***HTML***. While notebooks support some HTML, a limitation of HTML is that it is often difficult to read HTML source when not ***rendered*** in a web browswer.

For example, [github.com](https://github.com) allows you to view .ipynb files with nice rendering (i.e. the markdown text is nicely formatted and the code cell output is nicely viewable), but it does not link to a python kernel and thus does not let you edit or run cells. Note that you can open and edit an .ipynb file with a simple text editor (such as notepad, textedit, or nano). However, the text cells will not be rendered (you will see the pure text rather than pretty formatting). You will be able to see and edit the code cells.

        "**Base 10.** In the base 10 number system, we use the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. A shift of one digit to the left means the digit represents 10 times more (ex: 2 and 20), two spaces to the left means multiplying by 100. Stated another way, the rightmost position of a base 10 integer represents the number of *ones* ($10^0$), the second from the right position represents the number of *tens* ($10^1$), the third from the right position represents the number of *hundreds* ($10^2$), and the $n^{th}$ position from the right represents the number of $10^ns$. For example, the number 234 means: four ones, three tens, and two hundreds.\n",

(Note: we usually write binary numbers with a leading \"0b\" so that we don't confuse them with decimal numbers, i.e. 101 --> 0b101) The rightmost binary integer position represents the number of *ones* ($2^0$), the second from the right position represents the number of *twos* ($2^1$), the third position from the right represents the number of *fours* ($2^2$), the fourth position from the right represents the number of *eights* ($2^3$), and so on. Base 2 is especially important for computers since data is usually represented by elements that can be in one of only two states. For example, as mentioned earlier, the voltage on a wire can be either high or low, representing either a 1 or 0. Each digit in binary represents a ***bit*** of data. Eight bits of data are called a ***byte***.\n",

For example 0x10 represents 16 in base ten. A shift of one to the left represents multiplying by 16, a shift of two to the left represents multiplying by 256 (i.e. 16*16), and shifting by $n$ spaces to the left represents multiplying by $16^n$).\n",
