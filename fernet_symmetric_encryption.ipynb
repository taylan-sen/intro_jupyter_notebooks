        "A fernet key, with its 44 character length (256 bits), is typically too hard for most people to memorize, and is even a chore to manually write down or type. Fernet itself does not directly support transforming a short password into a 44-character key. However, the python **hashlib** module provides the pbkdf2_hmac method of transforming a short password into a secure 44 character (256 bit) key. This method takes special steps to protect from a cryptoraphic vulnerability associated with short passwords known as a **precomputation attack** (aka rainbow table attack).  \n",

        "In summary, the hashlib module's pbkdf2_hmac() function uses a one-way function (e.g. a \"secure hash function\" such as SHA256) to produce a 256 bit key from a short phrase. The short phrase is concatenated with a short random phrase (**salt**), and then passed through the hashfunction multiple iterations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Fernet also requires that the key be \"URL-safe\", meaning it should only consist of characters which can safely be included in URL query parameters (e.g. no + or /).  The code below uses the python base64 module's urlsafe_b64encode function to make the key from pbkdf2_hmac() URL-safe.\n"
